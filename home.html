			<div class="about">Omar wanted to become a better person ever since he was 14 years old. When he got his first computer in 2008, he created his first graphic artwork which was a painting of his beloved Mother. That was the beginning of his artistic and front end engineering life, which led him to explore a world beyond the two, that is: hacking the life of designers to accommodate system development. The result..?
			Shape, an adobe extension for the inevitable usage of font icons that is friendly to both entities.</div>

It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets</div>
