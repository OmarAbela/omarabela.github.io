      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p class="lead">
        I am a Technical Product Manager with a strong foundation as a Technical Product Owner, experienced in owning the full product lifecycle, from idea discovery and requirement definition to delivery, optimisation, and performance measurement. Over the years, I’ve led complex, high-impact products in the iGaming, affiliate, and fintech (trading applications) sectors, consistently transforming business objectives into scalable, data-driven solutions.
      </p>
      <div class="more" id="about-more">
        <p>
          My career began with a deep interest in user experience, graphic arts, and web development, which evolved into a passion for building digital products that balance functionality, usability, and commercial impact. As a Product Owner, I specialised in translating business needs into clear technical specifications, defining user stories, managing backlogs, and enabling efficient Agile delivery. My work required close collaboration with engineering, QA, design, DevOps, and commercial teams, helping to streamline processes, improve communication, and accelerate time-to-market.
        </p>
        <p>
          Stepping into Technical Product Management, I expanded my scope from execution to strategy shaping product vision, prioritising outcomes over outputs, driving roadmap definition, and aligning stakeholder expectations across technology, marketing, data, compliance, and operations. I have managed products across the full SDLC and multiple regulatory environments, particularly in iGaming and fintech, where accuracy, performance, and compliance are critical.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the iGaming and affiliate industries, I gained hands-on experience improving player experiences, optimising acquisition funnels, managing integrations with third-party data and feed providers, and delivering high-converting content and affiliate journeys. In fintech, I contributed to the development of trading applications, focusing on platform stability, real-time data flows, user onboarding, and regulatory requirements ensuring both technical robustness and user trust.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am motivated by solving complex problems, improving user experiences, and creating products that deliver measurable business value. With a blend of technical fluency, analytical thinking, and customer-centric product leadership, I aim to drive innovation and make a meaningful impact in dynamic, high-growth environments.

          <p>
            With over eight years of experience in web design and front-end development, I specialise in delivering products that focus on exceptional user experience and measurable business value. I’m skilled at navigating the full product lifecycle from gathering and refining requirements to designing, building, and validating front-end solutions within iterative, user-centric development cycles.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout my career, I’ve had the opportunity to work within agile teams and also lead them as a Technical Product Owner in the iGaming sector. This role strengthened my ability to align stakeholders, translate complex requirements into clear user stories, prioritise effectively, and guide cross-functional teams toward impactful outcomes.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am experienced in agile methodologies, scrum, unit and A/B testing, code validation, retrospectives, and continuous improvement practices. Additionally, I’ve managed digital channels and grown online engagement through data-driven optimisation. I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy transforming insights and requirements into scalable, high-quality products.
